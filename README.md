# UC1 – Ability to Create a Weight Object

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Create a Quantity Measurement application that:

- Allows creation of a **Weight** object
- Stores weight value
- Ensures object is successfully created

In UC1, we only focus on **object creation**, not comparison.

## 🎯 Objective of UC1

1. Create a `Quantity` class  
2. Store weight value  
3. Verify object is created successfully  

This is the **foundation use case** for the entire project.
