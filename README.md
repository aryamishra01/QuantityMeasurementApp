# 📏 Quantity Measurement App

## 📌 Overview
The Quantity Measurement App compares two quantities (such as length, weight, volume, etc.) and provides comparison across different units.

The application will progressively add:

🔄 Conversion from one unit to another  
➕ Support for quantity arithmetic  
➖ Subtraction  
➗ Division  
🛡️ Cross-category validation  

This app is being developed incrementally. Each use case defines a specific scope, and development must strictly follow that scope.
