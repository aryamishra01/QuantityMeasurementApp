# 📏 Quantity Measurement App

## 📌 Overview
The Quantity Measurement App compares two quantities (such as length, weight, volume, etc.) and provides comparison across different units.

The application will progressively add:

🔄 Conversion from one unit to another  
➕ Support for quantity arithmetic  
➖ Subtraction  
➗ Division  
🛡️ Cross-category validation  

This app is being developed incrementally. Each use case defines a specific scope, and development must strictly follow that scope.

## ✅ UC1: Feet Measurement Equality

### 📖 Description
The QuantityMeasurementApp class checks the equality of two numerical values measured in feet. It ensures accurate comparison and handles important edge cases.

### 🔎 Preconditions
- The QuantityMeasurementApp class is instantiated.
- Two numerical values in feet are provided for comparison.

### 🔄 Main Flow
1. User inputs two numerical values in feet.
2. Input values are validated to ensure they are numeric.
3. The two values are compared for equality.
4. The result (true/false) is returned.

### 📤 Postconditions
- Returns true if both values are equal.
- Returns false if values are not equal.

### 🧠 Concepts Learned (UC1)
- ✅ Object Equality – Properly overriding `equals()` method  
- ✅ Floating-Point Comparison – Using `Double.compare()`  
- ✅ Null Safety  
- ✅ Type Safety  
- ✅ Encapsulation & Immutability
